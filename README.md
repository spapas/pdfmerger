# PDFMerger

A simple tool to merge pdfs files. Download it directly from the [releases](https://github.com/spapas/pdfmerger/releases/latest). 

Please notice that there are two files, a .exe and a .zip file. The .exe file contains everything in the .exe and *will be slower to start* compared to using the pdfmerger.exe from inside the .zip file.

## Development

This has been build with python 3.10 and tkinter. It uses pyinstall to generate a Windows executable.

See requirements.txt, pdfmerger.bat and workflows/package.yml for more.
